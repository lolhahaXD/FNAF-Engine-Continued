# Beta Files V2 out now!
Beta Files V2 is actually not set as a pre-release. Sorry man,
just an accident that i was to lazy to edit lol
Beta Files V2 kinda makes a easier Set Up process so thats one thing thats great
My honest opinion on v2 is : Same As V1 but with like a few changes wtf is this shit???
